    <h1>Base Number Introduction</h1>
    <p>Decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal are different numeral systems used to represent numbers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class ="paragraph-l1"><strong>Decimal (Base 10): </strong>The most commonly used system, consisting of digits from 0 to 9. It is based on powers of 10 and is widely used in daily life and most human-centric applications.</li>
      <li class ="paragraph-l1"><strong>Hexadecimal (Base 16): </strong>This system uses 16 digits, 0-9 and A-F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, and so on. It is often used in programming and digital systems for its compact representation of binary data.</li>
      <li class ="paragraph-l1"><strong>Binary (Base 2): </strong>This system uses only two digits, 0 and 1. It is the foundation of all modern computing systems, as computers operate using binary data through electrical signals.</li>
      <li class ="paragraph-l1"><strong>Octal (Base 8): </strong>Using digits from 0 to 7, the octal system was once commonly used in computing as a shorthand for binary numbers. It is less common today but still appears in some applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is Decimal (Base 10)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">A decimal number, also known as base 10, is a system of counting and representing numbers using ten distinct digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The decimal system is the most commonly used numeral system in everyday life, and it is the system we rely on for counting, measuring, and performing basic arithmetic.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">The decimal system operates on a place-value structure, where the position of each digit represents a different power of 10. For example, in the number 345, the digit 3 represents 3 hundreds (10^2), 4 represents 4 tens (10^1), and 5 represents 5 ones (10^0). This system allows us to express any number, no matter how large or small, using a combination of these ten digits.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">We use decimal numbers largely because humans historically had ten fingers, making it a natural system for counting. The flexibility of the decimal system means it can represent an infinite range of values, from simple counting to complex calculations. It forms the foundation of most mathematical, scientific, and financial calculations.</p>
    <h2>What is Hexadecimal (Base 16)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">A hexadecimal number, also known as base 16, is a system that uses sixteen distinct symbols to represent numbers. These symbols include the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, C represents 12, D represents 13, E represents 14, and F represents 15. Hexadecimal is commonly used in computing and digital systems because it provides a more compact and human-readable way to represent binary data.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">The hexadecimal system operates similarly to the decimal system but is based on powers of 16. Each position in a hexadecimal number represents an increasing power of 16, starting from 16^0 at the rightmost digit. For example, the hexadecimal number 2F3 is equivalent to (2 * 16^2) + (15 * 16^1) + (3 * 16^0), which equals 763 in decimal.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">Hexadecimal is particularly useful in programming and computer science, as it can easily represent binary values in a more concise form. For instance, a single hexadecimal digit can represent four binary digits (bits), making it easier to work with large binary numbers. It is widely used in contexts such as memory addressing, color codes in web design, and low-level computer programming.</p>
    <h2>What is Binary (Base 2)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">A binary or bin bit represents a single unit of data, either a number or a symbol, in the binary number system. Binary is also known as base 2 because it uses only two digits: 0 and 1. In this system, every number is represented as a combination of these two digits, making it the foundation of modern computing.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">Binary numbers are commonly used in digital electronics and computing, as computers process information in binary form through electrical signals, which can be either on (1) or off (0). For example, the binary number 1011 represents the decimal number 11, and it is read as one-zero-one-one in base 2.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">Unlike decimal, which uses a place value system based on powers of 10, binary uses powers of 2. Every position in a binary number represents an increasing power of 2, starting from 2^0 at the rightmost digit. This makes binary a highly efficient system for computers, which operate using this base to perform complex calculations and store data.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">Although binary numbers are limited to just two digits, they can represent an infinite range of values when combined in larger sequences. This is why binary is essential for all digital computing systems, from simple calculations to complex machine learning algorithms.</p>
    <h2>What is Octal (Base 8)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">An octal number, also known as base 8, is a numeral system that uses eight distinct symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. In octal, each digit represents a power of 8, making it a shorthand representation of binary numbers. The octal system is often used in computing and digital systems, especially in older technologies, as it provides a more compact way to express binary data without requiring as many digits as hexadecimal.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">Each position in an octal number represents an increasing power of 8, starting from 8^0 at the rightmost digit. For example, the octal number 175 is equivalent to (1 * 8^2) + (7 * 8^1) + (5 * 8^0), which equals 125 in decimal. This makes octal a convenient way to represent binary numbers in groups of three bits, as one octal digit corresponds to exactly three binary digits.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-p1">Although octal is not as commonly used today as binary or hexadecimal, it was once widely used in computer programming and digital electronics. It is still occasionally used in certain contexts, such as file permissions in Unix-based operating systems. The simplicity of the octal system makes it an important part of the history of digital computing.</p>
