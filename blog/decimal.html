        <article class="bg-[#d8e2dc] p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Decimal, also known as Base 10, is the numbering system most commonly used in everyday life. It is the
                foundation of arithmetic and mathematics as we know it. The decimal system uses ten digits: <strong>0,
                    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9</strong>. Each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10,
                starting from 10<sup>0</sup> on the right. This system is intuitive and easy to use, which is why it has
                been adopted universally for most human activities.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">How Does Decimal Work?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In the decimal system, each digit in a number has a place value based on its position. For example, the
                number <code>345</code> can be broken down as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>3 × 10<sup>2</sup> = 300</li>
                <li>4 × 10<sup>1</sup> = 40</li>
                <li>5 × 10<sup>0</sup> = 5</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Adding these values together gives <strong>345</strong>. This positional notation makes the decimal
                system highly efficient for representing large numbers.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why is Decimal Important?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The decimal system is important because it is the most natural numbering system for humans. This is
                likely because humans have ten fingers, which historically made it easier to count and calculate using
                groups of ten. The decimal system is also the basis for most modern arithmetic operations, including
                addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Beyond its intuitive nature, the decimal system is essential for commerce, science, and engineering. It
                is used to measure quantities, calculate prices, and express scientific data in a standardized format.
                The decimal system's simplicity and universality make it the preferred choice for most applications.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Applications of Decimal</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The decimal system is used in virtually every aspect of modern life. Here are some key applications:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Most currencies around the world are based on the decimal system. For
                    example, 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents.</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> The metric system, which is used for scientific and everyday
                    measurements, is based on powers of 10.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Decimal is the foundation of arithmetic and is used in almost all
                    mathematical calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> While computers use binary internally, decimal is often used in user
                    interfaces and programming to make data more human-readable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Decimal in Everyday Life</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Decimal is deeply embedded in our daily lives. From reading the time on a clock to calculating the total
                cost of groceries, the decimal system is everywhere. It is also used in sports to measure distances and
                times, in education to teach basic arithmetic, and in technology to display numerical data in a format
                that is easy to understand.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Historical Background</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The decimal system has ancient roots. It was first used by the ancient Egyptians and later adopted by
                the Greeks and Romans. The modern decimal system, including the concept of zero, was developed in India
                around the 5th century CE and was later introduced to Europe through Arabic scholars. This system
                revolutionized mathematics and laid the foundation for modern science and technology.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Fun Fact About Decimal</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Did you know that the word "decimal" comes from the Latin word <em>decimus</em>, meaning "tenth"? This
                reflects the system's base of 10, which has been used for thousands of years to simplify counting and
                calculations.
