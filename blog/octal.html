        <article class="bg-[#d8e2dc] p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Octal, also known as Base 8, is a numbering system that uses eight unique symbols: <strong>0, 1, 2, 3,
                    4, 5, 6, and 7</strong>. It is primarily used in computing and digital systems as a more compact
                representation of binary numbers. Each octal digit represents three binary bits, making it an efficient
                way to express large binary values in a shorter form.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">How Does Octal Work?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In the octal system, each position in a number represents a power of 8. For example, the octal number
                <code>157</code> can be broken down as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>1 × 8<sup>2</sup> = 64</li>
                <li>5 × 8<sup>1</sup> = 40</li>
                <li>7 × 8<sup>0</sup> = 7</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Adding these values together gives <strong>111</strong> in decimal. This positional notation makes the
                octal system a convenient way to represent binary numbers in a more human-readable format.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why is Octal Important?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Octal is important because it simplifies the representation of binary numbers. While binary is the
                native language of computers, it can become cumbersome for humans to read and interpret long binary
                sequences. Octal reduces the length of binary numbers by grouping them into sets of three bits and
                representing each group with a single octal digit.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Octal was historically used in early computing systems, particularly in mainframes and minicomputers.
                Although hexadecimal has largely replaced octal in modern computing, octal remains relevant in specific
                contexts, such as Unix file permissions and certain low-level programming tasks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Applications of Octal</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Octal is used in various applications, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Unix File Permissions:</strong> In Unix and Linux systems, file permissions are often
                    represented in octal notation. For example, <code>755</code> indicates read, write, and execute
                    permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for others.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Systems:</strong> Octal is used in some digital systems to simplify binary
                    representations.</li>
                <li><strong>Legacy Systems:</strong> Older computing systems and programming languages, such as
                    assembly, often used octal for memory addresses and instructions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Octal in Everyday Life</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                While octal is not as commonly used as decimal or hexadecimal, it still plays a role in specific
                technical fields. For example, octal is used in certain types of data encoding and in the design of
                digital circuits. It is also used in educational settings to teach the fundamentals of number systems
                and their conversions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Historical Background</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The octal system has its roots in early computing. It was widely used in the 20th century when computer
                systems were designed with word sizes that were multiples of three bits. This made octal a natural
                choice for representing binary data. Although hexadecimal has largely replaced octal in modern
                computing, octal remains an important part of computing history and is still used in specific
                applications today.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Fun Fact About Octal</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Did you know that the octal system is sometimes called "oct" for short? The term "oct" comes from the
                Latin word <em>octo</em>, meaning "eight," reflecting the system's base of 8.
