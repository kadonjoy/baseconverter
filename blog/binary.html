        <article class="bg-[#d8e2dc] p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Binary, also known as Base 2, is a numbering system that uses only two digits: <strong>0</strong> and
                <strong>1</strong>. It is the foundation of all modern computing and digital systems. Unlike the decimal
                system, which uses ten digits (0-9), binary is simpler and more efficient for machines to process. Each
                binary digit, or <em>bit</em>, represents a power of 2, starting from 2<sup>0</sup> on the right. This
                simplicity makes binary the perfect language for computers, as it directly maps to the on/off states of
                electronic circuits.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">How Does Binary Work?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In binary, each position in a number represents a power of 2, similar to how each position in a decimal
                number represents a power of 10. For example, the binary number <code>1011</code> can be converted to
                decimal as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>1 × 2<sup>3</sup> = 8</li>
                <li>0 × 2<sup>2</sup> = 0</li>
                <li>1 × 2<sup>1</sup> = 2</li>
                <li>1 × 2<sup>0</sup> = 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Adding these values together gives <strong>11</strong> in decimal. So, <code>1011</code> in binary
                equals <code>11</code> in decimal. This method of conversion is fundamental to understanding how
                computers interpret and process data.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why is Binary Important?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Binary is essential because it directly maps to the physical states of electronic circuits. A
                <strong>1</strong> represents "on," and a <strong>0</strong> represents "off." This binary
                representation allows computers to perform calculations, store data, and execute instructions
                efficiently. The simplicity of binary also reduces the complexity of hardware design, making it easier
                to build reliable and scalable systems.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Beyond its technical advantages, binary has a profound philosophical significance. It represents the
                duality of existence: yes and no, true and false, light and dark. This duality is not only the basis of
                computing but also a reflection of how humans perceive and categorize the world.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Applications of Binary</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Binary is used in virtually every aspect of modern technology. Here are some key applications:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> All digital data, including text, images, audio, and video, is stored
                    in binary format. For example, a single character in text is represented by a binary code, such as
                    <code>01000001</code> for the letter "A" in ASCII.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Networking:</strong> IP addresses, subnet masks, and other networking protocols rely on
                    binary representation to route data efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Binary is the foundation of machine code, the low-level instructions
                    that computers execute directly. High-level programming languages are ultimately translated into
                    binary for execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Logic Gates:</strong> Binary is the basis of logic gates, which are the building blocks of
                    digital circuits. These gates perform basic logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT, enabling
                    complex computations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Binary in Everyday Life</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Binary is not just for computers. It is also used in everyday technologies such as barcode systems, QR
                codes, and even in some musical compositions where patterns of 0s and 1s represent beats. Additionally,
                binary is used in error detection and correction algorithms, ensuring the accuracy of data transmission
                in communication systems.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Historical Background</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The binary system has ancient roots. It was first described by the Indian mathematician
                <strong>Pingala</strong> in the 3rd century BCE as a way to represent poetic meters. In the 17th
                century, <strong>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</strong> formalized binary arithmetic and recognized its
                potential for representing logical operations. Leibniz's work laid the foundation for modern computing,
                and his vision of binary as a universal language continues to inspire innovation.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Fun Fact About Binary</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Did you know that binary is also used in the design of modern art and architecture? Some artists and
                architects use binary patterns to create visually striking designs that symbolize the intersection of
                technology and creativity.
