        <article class="bg-[#d8e2dc] p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Hexadecimal, also known as Base 16, is a numbering system that uses 16 unique symbols: <strong>0, 1, 2,
                    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F</strong>. It is widely used in computing and digital
                systems because it provides a compact and human-readable representation of binary numbers. Each
                hexadecimal digit represents four binary bits, making it an efficient way to express large binary
                values.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">How Does Hexadecimal Work?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In the hexadecimal system, each position in a number represents a power of 16. For example, the
                hexadecimal number <code>1A3</code> can be broken down as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>1 × 16<sup>2</sup> = 256</li>
                <li>A × 16<sup>1</sup> = 160 (where A = 10 in decimal)</li>
                <li>3 × 16<sup>0</sup> = 3</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Adding these values together gives <strong>419</strong> in decimal. This positional notation makes the
                hexadecimal system highly efficient for representing large numbers in a compact form.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Why is Hexadecimal Important?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Hexadecimal is important because it bridges the gap between binary and human-readable formats. While
                computers operate in binary (Base 2), binary numbers can become very long and difficult to interpret.
                Hexadecimal simplifies this by grouping binary digits into sets of four and representing them with a
                single hexadecimal digit. This makes it easier for programmers and engineers to work with binary data.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Hexadecimal is also widely used in programming, particularly in low-level languages like assembly and
                C. Memory addresses, color codes in web design, and machine instructions are often represented in
                hexadecimal for clarity and brevity.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Applications of Hexadecimal</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Hexadecimal is used in various applications, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Memory Addresses:</strong> In computing, memory locations are often represented in
                    hexadecimal for simplicity.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Codes:</strong> Web designers use hexadecimal to define colors, such as
                    <code>#FFFFFF</code> for white and <code>#000000</code> for black.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Hexadecimal is used in debugging tools to display binary data in a
                    readable format.</li>
                <li><strong>Networking:</strong> IP addresses and MAC addresses are often represented in hexadecimal
                    notation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Hexadecimal in Everyday Life</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Hexadecimal is not just for computers. It is also used in everyday technologies such as QR codes,
                barcode systems, and even in some encryption algorithms. Additionally, hexadecimal is used in
                scientific fields to represent large numbers compactly.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Historical Background</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The hexadecimal system has its roots in the early days of computing. It was introduced as a way to
                simplify the representation of binary data. The use of hexadecimal became widespread with the advent of
                digital computers in the mid-20th century. Today, it remains an essential tool for programmers and
                engineers working with low-level data.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Fun Fact About Hexadecimal</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Did you know that the hexadecimal system is sometimes called "hex" for short? The term "hex" comes from
                the Greek word <em>hex</em>, meaning "six," reflecting the system's base of 16.
